# pathToJSON
**Program that returns structure of directory as JSON format.**
By default program returns structure of directory in which file index.php is placed. 
**Program runs through all directories in path you given recursively.**
You can change it by going into index.php and calling function with other path.

```
$structureJSON = json_encode(getStructure(__DIR__)); // change __DIR__ to your path.
```
Function getStructure(path) return whole structure as associative array which then is changed to JSON format with built in function json_encode.

* * Example of returned JSON format
